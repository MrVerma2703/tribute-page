The Tribute Page Is The Headstone Of The Future .A tribute page is an online memorial website where people gather virtually to celebrate, honor, and remember a loved one and the legacy they left. Here, friends and family can share stories, photos, and memories as well as support and comfort for one another. A tribute page is more than that, though. It’s also an information hub, housing details about the memorial service, the obituary, and ways to support the immediate family of the deceased.And finally, a tribute page is a place to go when the dust has settled and the loss morphs into a permanent part of life. Birthdays, anniversaries, favorite holidays, and even those random emotional days are perfect times to “go visit” your loved one.
